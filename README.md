## Intro
- Rust uses the `print!` and `println!` macros to print text to the console.
- Positional arguments can be used `println!("Hello {}!", "world");`.

## Variables
In Rust, variables are immutable by default.
When a variable is immutable, once a value is bound to a name, you canâ€™t change that value.
You can make them mutable by adding `mut` in front of the variable name.
- Declare a variable using `let`
- A variable should be given an explicit type and a value. `let x: i32 = 0;`
- Shadowing: you can declare a new variable with the same name as a previous variable.  https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html#shadowing
- Constants `const NUMBER: i32 = 3;`

## Functions
- Rust requires that all parts of a function's signature have type annotations.
- After the `->`. This is where the function's return type should be.
- Rust distinguishes between expressions and statements: expressions return a value based on their operand(s), and statements simply return a () type which behaves just like `void` in C/C++ language. To return the value, use `return` or remove the semicolon at the end.

## If statement (control flow)
- `if` condition does not need to be surrounded by parentheses.
- Each condition is followed by a `{}` block.
- Multiple conditions: `if condition {} else if condition2 {} else {}`.
- In Rust, every arm of an `if` expression has to return the same type of value.
